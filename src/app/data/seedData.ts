The 10 Year Health Plan (July 2025) directly ties trust income to patient ratings through clinical team payments, patient power payments, and publicly published league tables updated quarterly from summer 2025. Yet most trusts still rely on manual coding, sampled data, and disconnected reporting systems that prevent timely action. There is no NHS-native platform that combines AI-powered theme classification, closed-loop feedback management, and integration with clinical systems — leaving organisations unable to detect emerging risks early or demonstrate improvement to regulators and boards.`;

<h2>Market Moment</h2>
<p>The 10 Year Health Plan (published July 2025) creates a step-change in the materiality of patient feedback. For the first time, trust income is directly tied to patient ratings through three mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clinical team payment</strong> tied to feedback scores</li>
<li><strong>Patient power payments</strong> — patients influence whether providers get paid in full</li>
<li><strong>Public league tables</strong> including patient ratings, updated quarterly from summer 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>The Medium Term Planning Framework (October 2025) already mandates all providers capture near-real-time feedback on at least 5 wards before patient discharge — this is a <strong>current compliance requirement</strong>, not a future risk.</p>
<h2>Addressable Market</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Segment</th><th>Annual Opportunity</th><th>Window</th></tr>
<tr><td>~311 NHS trusts (acute, mental health, community, ambulance)</td><td>£18–40M ARR core NHS. Secondary: 42 ICBs</td><td>18–24 months before a US competitor makes a serious NHS push</td></tr>

<h2>Competitive Landscape</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Competitor</th><th>AI Themes</th><th>Risk Alert</th><th>NHS Integrations</th><th>Board Output</th><th>Our Advantage</th></tr>
<tr><td>Qualtrics</td><td>Limited</td><td>✗</td><td>✗</td><td>Template</td><td>Generic; no NHS context, no FFT/PALS ingest, no early-warning logic</td></tr>

<h2>Tailwinds</h2>
<ul>
<li>10YHP makes feedback financially material — direct income linkage</li>
<li>NHS App generating 10× more ratings data than legacy FFT</li>
<li>CQC Well-Led inspections increasingly scrutinise feedback use</li>
<li>Every major care scandal cited unread patient feedback as a warning sign</li>
<li>ICB consolidation creates demand for system-level views</li>
<li>NHS England actively seeking market input for a 'holistic insight system'</li>
</ul>
<h2>Headwinds</h2>
<ul>
<li>NHS procurement cycles are 12–18 months</li>
<li>Data governance / IG requirements add complexity to onboarding</li>
<li>Existing Civica/Cerner contracts create inertia at the data layer</li>

<h2>Scope — What This Discovery Covers</h2>
<p>This plan is scoped to what is required to confidently build and demonstrate the MVP. It does not attempt to validate every future feature — only the assumptions that would invalidate the MVP if wrong. The MVP scope (AI theme classification, sentiment alerting, ward digest, board pack) is treated as fixed input; discovery informs <em>how</em> to build it, not <em>whether</em> to.</p>
<h2>Stage 1 — User Interviews (1 Round)</h2>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> 6–9 participants — 2–3 Chief Nurses, 2–3 Quality Managers, 2–3 Ward Managers across 2–3 NHS trusts.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Validate core pain points, understand current feedback workflows, and pressure-test the MVP feature set against real daily needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruit participants across trust types (acute, community, mental health)</li>
<li>Semi-structured interview guide — 45 minutes per session</li>
<li>Chief Nurse focus: board accountability, CQC anxiety, 10YHP income exposure</li>
<li>Quality Manager focus: current manual process, sampling rates, what a useful alert looks like</li>
<li>Ward Manager focus: digest format, time constraints, positive feedback appetite</li>
<li>Capture verbatim quotes; note surprises and contradictions</li>
<li>Synthesise into 5–7 key insight themes within 48 hours of final interview</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 2 — Feedback Analysis (Platform &amp; Dashboard Scope)</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Analyse interview findings and existing NHS FFT data to confirm and sharpen the MVP platform and dashboard design. Keep scope tightly bounded to what the MVP must deliver — no scope creep.</p>
<ul>
<li>Affinity map all interview observations into clusters</li>
<li>Cross-reference insight themes against MVP feature list — confirm each feature has a user need behind it</li>
<li>Identify any MVP features that lack evidence — flag for de-scoping or deferral</li>
<li>Define must-have dashboard views for each persona (Chief Nurse, Quality Manager)</li>
<li>Validate alert threshold logic against real user mental models of "urgent" vs "monitor"</li>
<li>Produce a one-page MVP scope confirmation document as a shared team reference</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 3 — Tech Discovery</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Evaluate technical options and confirm feasibility for the specific capabilities needed in the MVP. De-risk architecture decisions before build begins.</p>
<ul>
<li>NHS data ingest: FFT CSV/API, NHS App ratings — format audit across 2 trusts</li>
<li>AI/NLP model selection: evaluate options for theme classification on NHS free-text (accuracy vs cost vs latency)</li>
<li>Run a classification spike on 300–500 real FFT comments; validate against expert-coded ground truth</li>
<li>Data residency and IG requirements: confirm UK cloud hosting approach and DTAC timeline</li>
<li>Build vs buy assessment for key MVP components (alerting engine, digest delivery)</li>
<li>Document architecture decisions in a lightweight ADR (Architecture Decision Record)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 4 — Ideation &amp; Hypothesis Creation</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Translate interview insights and tech findings into a prioritised set of testable hypotheses for the MVP. Use structured methods to surface the right problems before jumping to solutions.</p>
<ul>

<h2>Verdict: BUILD — with 4 targeted pivots</h2>
<p>All four decision gates pass. The problem is real, well-evidenced, and currently unsolved at scale. The 10YHP has materially increased urgency. NHS England is actively seeking market input on a 'sustainable and holistic insight system.' The technical spike confirms AI classification is achievable. One IG pivot required (on-premise option). Proceed to sprint planning with revised assumptions.</p>
<h2>Top 5 Findings That Change What We Build</h2>
<p><strong>F1 — IG gate passes, conditionally.</strong> 3 of 4 IG leads would approve a cloud processor, but only with UK data residency and DPIA completed before any patient data is transferred. One trust requires an on-premise processing option as a hard condition.</p>
<p><strong>F2 — AI accuracy reaches 89% out-of-the-box.</strong> Sentiment accuracy is strong (94%). Theme accuracy drags to 86% on dignity/respect and multi-theme comments. A revised taxonomy splitting 'dignity and respect' into two concrete sub-categories closes the gap. Estimated: 2 days of engineering.</p>
<p><strong>F3 — Alert fatigue is the #1 risk — from too many true positives, not false ones.</strong> Quality Managers didn't reject false positives; they rejected too many true positives. Only the top-3 deteriorating wards should appear in red by default.</p>
<p><strong>F4 — Ward managers will not log in — ever.</strong> All four ward managers confirmed this unprompted. The email digest is the only viable touchpoint. It must always contain at least one positive comment.</p>
<p><strong>F5 — The real near-term driver is compliance, not payment linkage.</strong> The 10YHP patient power payment is in trial phase. However, the Medium Term Planning Framework already mandates near-real-time feedback. Lead with compliance in sales conversations.</p>
<h2>Technical Spike Results</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Theme</th><th>Accuracy</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><td>Communication</td><td>92%</td><td>Clear language cues. Model distinguishes well from dignity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Environment &amp; facilities</td><td>95%</td><td>Most reliable. Highly concrete vocabulary (noise, cleanliness, food).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Waiting &amp; delays</td><td>93%</td><td>Time language is specific and consistent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Clinical care &amp; treatment</td><td>89%</td><td>Main error: confusing clinical skill feedback with staffing levels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Staffing &amp; attitudes</td><td>87%</td><td>Overlaps with communication and dignity themes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dignity &amp; respect</td><td>76%</td><td>Weakest category. Dignity language is often euphemistic. Requires taxonomy split.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Sentiment (overall)</strong></td><td><strong>94%</strong></td><td>Strong. Positive/negative/neutral classification highly reliable.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Overall accuracy</strong></td><td><strong>89%</strong></td><td>Short of 92% target. Taxonomy change closes to 91–93% without fine-tuning.</td></tr>

<h2>Gate Verdicts</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Gate</th><th>Verdict</th><th>Evidence &amp; Conditions</th></tr>
<tr><td>IG / CISO Gate</td><td>✓ PASS</td><td>3/4 IG leads approve with conditions: UK residency, ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials Plus, DPIA. 1 trust requires on-premise — add as Year 2 option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>AI Accuracy Gate</td><td>✓ PASS (conditional)</td><td>89% overall vs 85% gate criterion. Passes gate. 92% PRD target needs taxonomy change (2-day task).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alert Design Gate</td><td>✓ PASS</td><td>3/3 QMs tested said they would act on a red alert — but only on the top-3 design. All-wards design failed unanimously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Commercial Gate</td><td>✓ PASS</td><td>1 LOI signed at £45k (North West acute trust). 2 trusts at commercial terms stage. Pipeline projects £200k ARR by Year 1 end.</td></tr>

<h2>PRD Pivots Before Sprint 1</h2>
<p><strong>Pivot 1 — Alert UX:</strong> Default alert dashboard shows top-3 deteriorating wards only. All wards accessible via 'show all' toggle. Alert fatigue confirmed as primary adoption risk.</p>
<p><strong>Pivot 2 — Ward Manager interface:</strong> Ward-facing web app deprioritised from MVP to Next phase. Email digest elevated to P0. Add 'share with team' one-tap link. Magic link expiry: 7 days.</p>
<p><strong>Pivot 3 — AI taxonomy:</strong> Split 'dignity and respect' into: 'Privacy and dignity' and 'Feeling dismissed or not listened to.' Revise accuracy target to ≥91% overall.</p>
<p><strong>Pivot 4 — Architecture:</strong> Add on-premise deployment option to architecture design (Year 2 delivery, architecture decision now). Post-Synnovis risk appetite shift means ~15–20% of large acute trusts may require this.</p>
<h2>Immediate Actions Before Sprint 1</h2>
<ol>
<li>Rewrite US-01 and US-03 in the PRD to reflect top-3 alert default and email-primary ward manager interface.</li>
<li>Begin DTAC and DPIA process for pilot trust immediately. Target: DPIA first draft to trust IG team within 3 weeks.</li>
<li>Apply taxonomy change and re-run classification on 500-comment validation set. Confirm ≥91% before production code is written.</li>
<li>Schedule ward naming mapping workshop with pilot trust Quality Manager before sprint planning.</li>
<li>Begin G-Cloud application process. Takes 4–8 weeks — start now, not after first contract closes.</li>
<li>Prepare Finance Director ROI pack: staff hours saved + CQC inadequate rating cost avoidance + 10YHP compliance framing.</li>

<h2>Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Converts a previously unanalysable data asset (free-text patient feedback) into financial and reputational protection. The value is <strong>existential, not incremental</strong>.</p>
<h2>Why Now</h2>
<ul>
<li>The 10YHP creates direct financial consequences for poor feedback performance — for the first time in NHS history</li>
<li>The MTPF mandates near-real-time ward feedback monitoring from October 2025 — compliance is not optional</li>
<li>NHS App has 10× the data volume of legacy FFT — the data asset exists; the intelligence layer does not</li>
<li>NHS England is actively seeking market input on a 'sustainable and holistic insight system' — political tailwind</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business Model</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Element</th><th>Detail</th></tr>
<tr><td>Model</td><td>Annual SaaS subscription per trust. Per-ward pricing tiers for smaller trusts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Entry price</td><td>£30–45k per annum for a mid-size acute trust (validated in discovery pricing interviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Procurement route</td><td>G-Cloud direct award (target Q3). Crown Commercial Service framework as fallback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Budget holder</td><td>Chief Nurse or Director of Quality (quality/safety budget, not IT budget — validated in discovery)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Year 1 target</td><td>£500k ARR. Year 2: £2M ARR. Requires 11–16 live trusts at average £45k.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Go-to-Market Sequencing</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Land:</strong> 2 pilot trusts on paid contracts before public launch. Use as reference sites and case study authors.</li>
<li><strong>Expand:</strong> G-Cloud listing enables direct award without tender. Target trusts with CQC Well-Led reviews scheduled in next 12 months.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage:</strong> ICB relationships open system-level conversations — one ICB = up to 10 trust conversations.</li>
</ol>
<h2>ROI Frame for Trust Finance Directors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff time saved:</strong> Quality Manager coding time: 2–3 days/quarter → 2 hours. At band 7 salary: ~£15k/year saved.</li>
<li><strong>CQC risk:</strong> A single 'Inadequate' rating on Well-Led costs £200k+ in remediation and reputational damage. One prevented inadequate rating pays for 4 years of platform cost.</li>
<li><strong>10YHP compliance:</strong> Non-compliance with near-real-time feedback mandate = regulatory exposure from Q1 2026.</li>
</ul>`)
